Django project creation steps using pycharm
--------------------------------------------------------
-> Open pycharm IDE -> file -> new project(sample)
-> Provide a project name in place of pythonProject1 in first link.
-> A project will be created with the name you provided.
-> If you don't have django installed in your pc, install it by following below steps
           - Go to terminal in pycharm IDE.
           - Enter this command : pip install Django
           - This will install Django 
-> Now we need to create a django project.
-> The following command is used to create the django project:
          - terminal : django-admin startproject myProject
-> A project will be created with an name of myProject.
-> Make sure to be in the project directory:
           - terminal : cd myProject
-> Now we need to create an app in our project:
           - terminal : python manage.py startapp myApp
-> An app will be created as myApp
-> You can verify the successfull creation of app by typing the following command;
          - terminal : python manage.py runserver
-> Open the link you will get in terminal and you will be redirected to successfull page of django.
          - browser : http://127.0.0.1:8000/ 
-> Django project is created successfully.
-> Now we can see our directory as follows:
         - sample
            - Lib
            - sampleproject
            - myApp
                > migrations
                    init.py
	admin.py
	apps.py
	models.py
	tests.py
	views.py
	urls.py
           - sampleproject
	init.py
	asgi.py
	settings.py
	urls.py
	wsgi.py

-> There will be no urls.py in myApp we need to create one to add our urls.
-> Now we need to configure some changes to work with django projects.
